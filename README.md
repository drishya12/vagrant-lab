In this lab, I learnt about vagrant and why is it used. It is time consuming to spin up virtual machines manually. Instead, using vagrant we can spin n number of VMâ€™s using commands in CLI. Vagrant file is an important concept in this. Vagrant file describes the type of guest machine and contains configurations to provisions these machines. I learnt to create single topology and multi-machine topology using ubuntu and centos images. I also learnt to sync folders between host and guest machines.
